#Code Book
This is the code book that describes the variables, the data and the transformations that I performed to clean up the data. 

###Data Source

*Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

*Description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

###Data set information
The experiement was conducted within a group of 30 volunteers with ages 19-48 years. Every person performed 6 different activitis (such as walking, wlaking upstairs, walking downstairs, etc.) while wearing a smartphone on the wrist (Samsung Galaxy S II). Using the accelerometer in the cell phone we were able to measure the acceleration and the velocity of the humans. 70% were selected to generate the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec ad 50% overlap. 

###The data
My dataset includes the following files:

*'README.txt'

*'features_info.txt': Info on the variables used on the feature vector.

*'features.txt': All the features.

*'activity_labels.txt': Connects class labels with their activity name.

*'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

*'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

*'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

*'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Files for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

*'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. (from 1 to 30)

*'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. (each row=128 element vector) The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

*'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': Subtract the gravity from the total acceleration.

*'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. (units= radians/second)


###Transformation description
There are 5 major changes:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###How is run_analysis.R implemented?

*I use reshapre2 and data.table libraries

*I load test and train data

*I load features and activity labels

*Extract the mean and std column names and data

*Process the test and train data

*Merge the data sets
